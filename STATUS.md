CURRENT STATUS FEATURE:

- Manually (follow README.md) looks like certificate works

BUT: 

when browser URL the answer is "This site canâ€™t provide a secure connection"

What we have: 

- nginx is running
- we reach the server (logs are updated)


looks like nginx is not properly configured to get SSL 
maybe the paths to the support files? 

We need a fucking log!!!!
