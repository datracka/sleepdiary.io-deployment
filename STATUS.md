CURRENT STATUS FEATURE:

- Manually (follow README.md) looks like certificate works

BUT: 

when browser URL the answer is "This site canâ€™t provide a secure connection"

What we have: 

- nginx is running
- we reach the server (logs are updated)

looks like nginx is not properly configured to get SSL 
- el path to SSL support files looks correct. 

We need a fucking log!!!!
